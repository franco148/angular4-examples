# Ng7ObservablesStart

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Concepts
### Observables
- It basically can be thought of as a data source. But in our angular project, an observable basically just is an object we import from a third-party package RxJS. The observable here is implemented in a way that it follows the observable pattern.

- There are three ways of handling data packages, we can handle DATA, ERRORS or COMPLETION of the observable, because these are the three types of data packages you can receive and in these hooks/boxes your code is executed.
- Observables is just a different alternative approch than callbacks and promises. Angular embraces observables which is why I chose to explain these because angular uses them a lot. 

- Observables have one major advantage their operators.
